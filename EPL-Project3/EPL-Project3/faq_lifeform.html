<p> Lifeform: Frequently Asked Questions> <br>

<ul>
<li> Could you tell me what the function "compute_next_move" is supposed 
to do ? I didn't have to use it in my implementation of any of the other
functions and it is private function. Is it ok for me to just make it an
empty function ? <br>
Just make it an empty function.
In my solution it is 3-lines long.  Most other programmers simply embed
these same 3 lines in the other functions (e.g., set_course, set_speed).
<br><br>

<li> In the project preview when you talk about the region_resize 
function, you say that schedule a update_position event and then 
schedule a border_cross event. <br>
Yes, I've seen it done that way.  I don't know if that's the way the 
solution does it.
<br><br>

<li> Why do we need to make update_position an event? First of all 
making it an event complicates matters as you have to get the new 
updated position to schedule the border cross and the event handler 
can execute only after region_resize is finished. <br>
1. To avoid making update_position re-entrant (the same function
appears on the stack at two places at the same time, as in a recursive
function). <br>
2. Yes.  Your event model becomes more complicated.  I'm not sure I
agree that the code becomes more complicated.
<br><br>

<li> When you have border cross and you update the position of your
neighbours, if there is a region_resize, then the update event is
scheduled , but that event cannot occur unless border_cross is completed.
<br>
You lost me on this line of reasoning.  Of course I can complete updating
my position, independently of other objects updating their position.
<br><br>

<li> In resolve_encounter, do we call the encounter functions before or
after applying the encounter penalty. In case it is after, what do we do
if one of the lifeforms dies on applying penalty - do nothing or go ahead
and call the encounter functions but do no eating. The encounter function
could possibly change the behaviour of the alive object. <br>

I don't think the answer matters.  I would suggest, however, that
you apply the encounter penalty first, then let the objects run
their encounter method (only if the object is still alive, of course).
<br><br>

<li> eat_cost_function(double, double) does not use its argument and its
not documented what they are supposed to be. Is it OK to pass them
constants ? <br>
Yes, I thought it was obvious. <br>
The two parameters are the energy of the life form performing the eating
(1st param) and the energy of the life form that is being 
eaten (2nd param). <br>
The params to eat_cost_function match the params to eat_success_chance.
Uniform interfaces is a very important aspect of good design.
<br><br>

<li> When a lifeform reproduces a child, I will try to find a place 
for the child that is at least encounter_distance far away from all 
other lifeforms (including its parent).  But what if I cannot find 
such a place? Should I call resolve_encounter immediately or should 
I schedule an check encounter event in time 0? Or should I just 
prevent parent from reproducing by child->die() (not charge 
reproduce_penalty)? <br>
You may do whatever you like. <br>
The solution attempts to find a "safe" position about 5 times.  
After that, whatever random position was last chosen is used.  
If that position is unsafe, the solution immediately resolves 
the encounter with the closest object (assuming that more than 
one object is within encounter_distance of the child).  Under 
no circumstances should the child encounter the parent. <br>
*when* to resolve the encounter is part of the design work that you 
should do.  both solutions (resolving the encounter immediately ---  
invoked as a subroutine of the reproduce function, and resolving 
the encounter as a future event (not too far in the future, of course)), 
can be made to work.

Contact TAs during office hours for any other query as sometimes its 
a difficult propostion to explain the situation in emails, though 
emails are still welcome.
